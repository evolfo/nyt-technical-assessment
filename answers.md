3. JavaScript Scope: What is the primary difference in variable scoping between using var and using let or const in modern JavaScript?

4. HTML Semantics: In modern HTML5, which element should generally be used to group a major introductory content block, typically containing a heading and an optional subtitle or introductory text?

I think A or C could be correct for this answer. Without the word "introductory" being included twice in the question, I would say A (<section>), but with that word there I think the answer could be either. <header> is typically what users see at the top of the page, it can be considered an intro to the site. <section> typically has a heading (h1, h2 etc.) included in it, but it isn't necessarily always an introductory content block even though it can be. I think it's more likely the answer is A but I think either could be valid based on the question.

A. <section>
C. <header>

5. CSS Layout (Flexbox): A container element has the CSS property display: flex;. Which property should be used on the container to distribute space between the flex items along the main axis, pushing the first item to the start and the last item to the end?

B. justify-content: space-between;

7. Event Bubbling: If you click a button that is nested inside a <div>, and both the button and the <div> have a click event listener attached, which element's listener will execute first during the bubbling phase?

B. The button listener.

8. JavaScript Array Methods: Which JavaScript Array method is used to iterate over all elements in an array and return a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element?
